        <p>Hi! My name is Josh and I recently started school
            at the University of Miami Coding Bootcamp!
            I've just recently gotten into coding and have
            created what you see thus far on this page.
            I started my coding journey on my own, working
            with python from free online resources, but have
            since expanded my knowledge to include html and css. 
        </p>
        <p> I'm very excited to share my website with all of you
            and show you all my front end development capabilities
            and possibly showing you all the progress I'm capable
            of making!
        </p>
