            <p>Hi! My name is Josh and I recently started school
                at the University of Miami Coding Bootcamp!
                I've just recently gotten into coding and have
                created what you see thus far on this page.
                I started my coding journey on my own, working
                with python from free online resources, but have
                since expanded my knowledge to include html and css. 
            </p>
            <p> I'm very excited to share my website with all of you
                and show you all my front end development capabilities
                and possibly showing you all the progress I'm capable
                of making!
            </p>
